# disease-predictor-dev-town-boot-campHeart Disease Detection using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to predict heart disease risk from patient health records. The model is trained on the Kaggle Heart Disease dataset and provides binary predictions:

1 → Heart Disease Likely

0 → No Heart Disease

📌 Project Goals

Clean and preprocess medical data (handling categorical & numerical features).

Explore patterns through EDA (visualizing cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type, etc.).

Train and compare multiple models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

Evaluate results using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Save the best-performing model and test on unseen patient inputs.

📊 Dataset

Source: Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset

Features: Age, Gender, Chest Pain, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Fasting Sugar, ECG, Max Heart Rate, Exercise-Induced Angina, Oldpeak, Slope, Thal, etc.

Target: Heart Disease (1) or No Heart Disease (0).

🛠️ Toolkit

Language: Python

Environment: Google Colab

Libraries:

pandas, numpy → data preprocessing

matplotlib, seaborn → visualization

scikit-learn → ML models & evaluation

joblib → save/load trained model

🤖 Results

Logistic Regression: Provided a good baseline.

Random Forest: Outperformed other models and gave the highest accuracy.

Important predictors included age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and ECG features.

🚀 Running the Project (Google Colab)

Open the notebook (.ipynb) in Google Colab.

Upload the Kaggle dataset or mount Google Drive.

Run the cells step by step to:

Preprocess the dataset

Train & evaluate models

Save/load the trained model

Test predictions on new inputs
